# PUBH7405: Biostatistical Inference I
Hello, everyone! Welcome to our shared space for PUBH7405!

### About Block Notes:
I’ve organized our class notes and placed the PDF versions in the "Block-notes" folder. As I’m still learning statistics, there may be some mistakes in the notes. Please feel free to comment or contribute by editing the LaTeX code in the "Block-Latex" folder, or reach out to me at yanweijin68@gmail.com for corrections.
  - Block 1's changes are located on the last pages of the document.

### About Homework and Exercises:
Let’s collaborate by sharing ideas, discussing, and solving homework and exercise problems together!

### Discussions
Feel free to ask questions, help each other with answers, or share your learning experiences in the "**Discussions**" section at the top.

**Note:** This repository will be continuously updated. Even though it's simple right now, we can improve it together!
