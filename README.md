### About Block Notes:
I’ve organized our class notes and placed the PDF versions in the "Block-notes" folder. As I’m still learning statistics, there may be some mistakes in the notes. Please feel free to comment or contribute by editing the LaTeX code in the "Block-Latex" folder, or reach out to me at yanweijin68@gmail.com for corrections.
